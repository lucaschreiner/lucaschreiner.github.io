# Install Plugins with packer.nvim
<hr>

<br>

First we have to create a directory for the Neovim configuration.<br>
```
mkdir ~/.config/nvim -p
```
We also need a ``init.lua`` so, let's create one:
```
touch ~/.config/nvim/init.lua
```
Next we need a lua directory where we put all our configuration and plugins.
```
mkdir ~/.config/nvim/lua

touch ~/.config/nvim/lua/plugins.lua
```

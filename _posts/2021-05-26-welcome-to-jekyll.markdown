<span style="font-size: 25px; color: #4E4949; font-family: Tahoma">Hi! I am Luca, I'm just a High School student from Germany. <br> 
I'm currently working on this Website / Blog, <br>
and I'm learning Java and Lua. <br>
I wanted to make this Website / Blog because I am programming since 1 year now, and I don't really had a Project to start with, so I decided to start my personal Website as a Project to learn HTML, CSS, and Jekyll. <br>
If you want you can contact me you can do it on [Instagram], [Twitter] or [GitHub].<br></span>
